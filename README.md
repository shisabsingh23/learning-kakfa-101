## Steps to create producer
* Create Producer properties
* Create Producer
* Send Data
* Flush and close the producer


## Questions
1) Why flush() and close() method are important?
* without those methods, producer might send not send msg and exit the program.

*   producer.send() method does not send the msg right away to kafka, puts the msg in queue as producer has buffer where it tries to bundled msg together and send in batches.
*   flush(): we say hey send all msg that is in buffer immediately to kafka and blocks the program until done.
*   close(): cleanup - free resources, etct. internally calls flush(), we did mention in code to explain flush() usage, flush() is optional.
